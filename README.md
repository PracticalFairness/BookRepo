# Welcome to the code repository for Practical Fairness

### This is the code repository that pairs with Practical Fairness (to be published December 2020). I expect all code samples to be posted by mid December if not sooner. You can contact me at Aileen A Nielsen at my gmail address. My email address is also posted in many places around the web and in the bok.

### Thank you in advance for comments, corrections, and enlargments you may wish to add to the repo or recommend via direct communicagtion.

### This book and code repo are very much a work in progress to reflect a nascent but important field, so I hope this code repo and the book can evolve with feedback from you. 

### Thank you.
